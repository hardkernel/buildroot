	  This is the Python XML package. The distribution contains a
	  validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM
	  programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat parser (and the
	  Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can speed up
	  xmllib.py by a factor of 5. There's even documentation!
