	  vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that keeps a log of
	  network traffic for the selected interface(s). It uses the network
	  interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source.
	  This means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also
	  ensures light use of system resources.
