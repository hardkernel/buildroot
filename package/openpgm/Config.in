	  OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic
	  General Multicast (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at
	  www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable and scalable multicast
	  protocol that enables receivers to detect loss, request
	  retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
	  unrecoverable loss.
