	  This is a set of GStreamer 1.0 plugins for plugins for Freescale's
	  i.MX platforms, which make use of the i.MX multimedia capabilities.

	  This software supports only the i.MX6 SoC family and requires a
	  kernel that includes the i.MX6 specific headers to be built.

	  The IPU and PXP plugins are always built.
	  The V4L2 plugin is built when BR2_PACKAGE_GST1_PLUGINS_BAD is enabled.
	  The VPU plugin is built when BR2_PACKAGE_LIBIMXVPUAPI is enabled.
	  The EGL plugin is built when BR2_PACKAGE_IMX_GPU_VIV is enabled.
	  The G2D plugin is built when BR2_PACKAGE_IMX_GPU_VIV_G2D is enabled.
	  The MP3 plugin is built when BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFSLCODEC is enabled.
