	  This is a set of GStreamer 1.0 plugins for plugins for Freescale's
	  i.MX6 platforms, with emphasis on video en/decoding using the VPU
	  engine.

	  This software supports only the i.MX6 SoC family and requires a
	  kernel that includes the i.MX6 specific headers to be built.

	  The software as a whole is currently in beta stage.
