	  This library provides GObject bindings for libudev.  It was
	  originally part of udev-extras, then udev, then systemd.
	  It's now a project on its own. Required for building some
	  programs that use udev, when using systemd.

	  When systemd is not used, libgudev is directly provided by
	  eudev.
