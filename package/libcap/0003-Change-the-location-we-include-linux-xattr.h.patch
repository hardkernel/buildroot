Subject: [PATCH] Change the location we include linux/xattr.h

This header stuff seems a bit fragile, but Serge reports including
it in sys/capability.h was causing a lot of trouble building dependent
app packages.

From the perspective of libcap, this API is only needed internally in
cap_file.c so we put an include there.

Status: upstream.
