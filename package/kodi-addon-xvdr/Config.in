	  This is a PVR add-on for Kodi to add VDR (http://tvdr.de/)
	  as a TV/PVR Backend to Kodi.

	  It adds support for Live TV watching, replaying of Recordings,
	  programming Timers and EPG TV Guide to use on same computer or
	  over the Network.

	  Note: since the VDR server is not packaged in Buildroot, using
	  this addon requires that a remote VDR server be used.
