        libdlna aims at being the reference open-source implementation of DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standards. Its primary goal is to provide DLNA support to uShare, an embedded DLNA & UPnP A/V Media Server, but it will be used to build both DLNA servers and players in the long term.
        libdlna is written in C and relies on FFMPEG librairies (libavformat and libavcodec) to handle and demux A/V streams. You still need libupnp to provide basic UPnP support to your project.
        libdlna is based on official DLNA specifications and aims at providing a complete respect of the defined standards. Right now, libdlna can be used to build compliant DLNA Media Servers.
        libdlna is free software - it is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU/LGPL) version 2.1+.
